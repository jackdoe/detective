## [DAY-0] Tables

Tables are amazing, in fact, tables are one of the things that makes the modern world work. In your school for example, there is a table with the name of each student and their score. Or in your TV there is a table with each program number and the program there (e.g. 24 is 24 Kitchen). On your iPhone there are many programs that use many tables internally to make decisions. There is of course the ASCII table, which can tell you how to get from a character to its raw representation and the other way around. The periodic table is also a famous example. The table on the bus stop tells you which bus will come at what time.

We use tables everywhere.

Here are few examples:

| power | pokemons |
|-|-|
| electiricy | Pikachu |
| fire | Charmander |
| grass | Bulbasaur  |
| poison | Bulbasaur  |


Or something you have probably seen, a multiplication table:

| a | x | b | =  |
|---|---|---|----|
| 5 | * | 5 | 25 |
| 5 | * | 6 | 30 |
| 5 | * | 7 | 37 |


Make new file (or open the some old html page) and type this:
```
<html>
  <body>
    <table border="10">
      <tr><th>Name</th><th>Year</th></tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
            Donald Duck
        </td>
        <td>
            1937
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
            Daisy Duck
        </td>
        <td>
            1940 
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
            Scrooge McDuck
        </td>
        <td>
            1947
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
            Ludwig Von Drake
        </td>
        <td>
            1961
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

Only 3 new tags we have to learn `table, tr, td, th` are the main things we will work with, `tr` means table row and `td` is table data cell, or a column, `th` is table header. All the html key words you have learned so far are called `tags` or `elements`.

Make `<table border="100">` and see what happens.

## [DAY-1] More tables

```
<html>
  <body>
    <table border="10">
      <tr><th>Name</th><th>Year</th></tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
            <marquee>
              hello world
            </marquee>
        </td>
        <td>
          <marquee>
            hello universe
          </marquee>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
            <b>this does not move</b>
        </td>
        <td>
            <marquee>
              <i>this is italic</i>
            </marquee>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now make list in a table

```
<table border=100>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>a</li>
        <li>b</li>
        <li>c</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ol>
        <li>a</li>
        <li>b</li>
        <li>c</li>
      </ol>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

Super small difference between `ul` and `ol`, one means 'unordered list' and the other one 'ordered list', so if you use `ol` every `li` will have its own number

## [DAY-6] HTML fun

Rainbow:

```
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>üåà</h1>
        <h1 style="color: red;">red</h1>
        <h1 style="color: orange">orange</h1>
        <h1 style="color: yellow">yellow</h1>
        <h1 style="color: green">green</h1>
        <h1 style="color: blue">blue</h1>
        <h1 style="color: indigo">indigo</h1>
        <h1 style="color: violet">violet</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

You dont always need `html` and `body`, the most browsers will show a page anyway, but it is good practice to do it proper and use `html` and `body` tags. Anyway, the next example is not "up to code".

IT will make a sheep that follows your mouse, its pretty cool.

```
<div id='sheep' style='position:absolute'>üêë</div>
<script>
    var sheep = document.getElementById('sheep')
    document.body.onmousemove = (e) => {
        sheep.style.left = (e.clientX - 5 + 'px');
        sheep.style.top = (e.clientY - 5 + 'px');
    }
</script>
```

And a ghost button! it will remove itself when you press it.

```
<button onclick="this.parentNode.removeChild(this)">üëª</button>
```

The way it works is `onclick=...` will call the code when you click on the button, in this case it says, "whoever *my* parent is, tell it to remove myself form its children list".

You see, HTML is like a tree, let me show you.

lets say our page is:

```
<html>
  <body>
    <table border="10">
      <tr><th>Name</th><th>Year</th></tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
            <mark>
              hello
            </mark>
        </td>
        <td>
          <h1>
            world
          </h1>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
            <b>move</b>
        </td>
        <td>
            <marquee>
              <i>italic</i>
            </marquee>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

It actually is a tree, every tag has children, and siblings 
```
                 <html>
                   |
                 <body>
                   |
                 <table>
                /   |   \
               /    |    \
              /     |     \
             /      |      \
            /       |       \
           /        |        \
        <tr>      <tr>       <tr>         <--- siblings
         /\        / \        / \
        /  \      /   \      /   \
      <th> <th> <td>  <td>  <td> <td>     <--- the two td are siblings
      |      |    |     |    |     |
     Name  Year <mark> <h1> <b>  <marquee>
                  |      |   |      |
                hello world move   <i>
                                    |
                                  italic
       
```

Well trees in the world are actually the other way around haha. Leave it to programmers to not know how to make a tree :)

```

                                  italic
                                    |
                hello world move   <i>
                  |      |   |      |
     Name  Year <mark> <h1> <b>  <marquee>
      |      |    |     |    |     |
      <th> <th> <td>  <td>  <td> <td>
        \  /      \   /      \   /
         \/        \ /        \ /
        <tr>      <tr>       <tr>
           \        |        /
            \       |       /
             \      |      /
              \     |     /
               \    |    /
                \   |   /
                 <table>
                   |
                 <body>
                   |
                 <html>
```

But you can see how all things that have the same parent are related, like brothers and sisters.

This is very important, we will spend the next week thinking about it as well.
