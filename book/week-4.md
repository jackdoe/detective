## [DAY-0] Basics of Basics

Make a new file form IDLE, and write in it:
```
print("Hi!")
```

Hit F5 and enjoy!

Your first(or second) python program.. Quite useless, but nevertheless. A program is a program!

`print()` is called a function, functions are kind of mini useful programs, this one will print whatever you tell it. In this case `print("Hi!")` will output `Hi!`. Pretty amazing, I hope one day to explain to you what goes into showing a character on your screen. Remind me to show you Ben Eater's 6502 videos when you grow up.

`"Hi!"` is a string, strings are just series of characters, you can make them in python with `"something"` or `'something'`, either single quotes or double quotes.

```
while True:
  print("Hi!")
```

`while True` that means forever. so you will see:

```
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
...

```

Hi forever.


```
while 1 == 1:
  print("Hi!)
```

`1 == 1` is also True, so this is the same as `while True`

So `while <condition>` will keep running the code **inside** it, while the condition holds true, which in the case of `1 == 1` will always be the case.

```
while True:
  zzz = input("what is your name: ")
  print(zzz)
```

`input` asks you to type something, and it returns whatever you typed.

`zzz = input(....)` takes whatever input returns, and puts it into memory that we can use later. `zzz` is just a name I picked so I can refer to this value later in the program, in this case on the next line when I do `print(zzz)`

`print(name)` prints whatever is in the memory pointed by `zzz`.

`zzz` is called a `variable`, you can choose the names of your variables, and `zzz` is surely a poor name, because if I use it 100 lines later in the code, I will forget what kind of information it stores, so usually we give names of the variables that make sense, for example:

```
while True:
  name = input("what is your name: ")
  print(name)
```

Now lets break out of the loop!

```
while True:
  name = input("what is your name: ")
  if name == "pikachu":
    break
```


`if name == "pikachu":` will run the code inside `if` if whatever is in the `name` variable is equal to the string "pikachu". In this case its only 1 instruction inside it, the `break` instruction.

`break` breaks out of the closest `while` loop, so basically this program will ask what is your name until you type pikachu. It is a bit boring because we never actually print what you typed.

```
while True:
  name = input("what is your name: ")
  print(name)
  if name == "pikachu":
    break

print("DONE")
```

There we go, now it will ask you to type a name, it will print whatever name you typed, and then it will check if the name is equal to "pikachu" it will break the while loop and stop asking. We can actually write this program in a different way. After you break out of the loop, it just continues to execute the program below, in this case will print DONE.

```
name = ''
while name != "pikachu":
  name = input("what is your name: ")
  print(name)

print("DONE")
```

MAGIC!

we start by making name equal to empty string, a string with no characters, and then we check is the statement `name != "pikachu"` True? If this is True we will execute the code **inside** the while loop, after the last instruction in the loop, the program jumps back to `while name != "pikachu"` and checks again is name still not equal to "pikachu"? if the statement is False it will not run the code **inside** but will continue, in the above example it will print DONE, because this is the first thing **after** the while loop.

Lets make a more complicated one, this one will ask you what is your name, and if you answer pikachu will print pikaaaaaaachuuuuu and stop, any other answer it will print "Hello, " + answer, so if you type "Jane" it will show "Hello, Jane" and it will ask again.

```
while True:
  name = input("what is your name: ")
  if name == "pikachu":
    print("pikaaaaaaachuuuuu")
    break
  else:
    print("Hello, " + name)
```


In python you can add two strings, if you type "charmander" for name, `x = "Hello, " + name`  will make x to be equal to "Hello, charmander". You can't do `"hello" - name`, but you can do `"hello" * 5` and get "hellohellohellohellohello".


`while,if,else,break` are keywords, kind of like `<html>` and `<body>`, `<h1>` etc, those are coming from python itself. There are not many python keywords, for reference, this is the **complete** list:

```
False
True
None

and      ->   name == "pikachu" and age == "33"
or       ->   name == "pikachu" or name == "charmander"
not      ->   not name == "pikachu" is the same as name != "pikachu"

for      -> used if you know how many times you want to do something
while    -> do something until condition is True
break    -> break out of the for or while loop 
continue -> go to the start of the while/for loop and continue from there

if       -> if something is true
elif     -> else if something else is true
else     -> else do this

in       -> checks if something is in somethhing else, e.g. "pika" in name
def      -> make a function

as
assert
async
await
class
del
except
finally
from
global
import
is
lambda
nonlocal
pass
raise
return
try
with
yield
```

THATS THE WHOLE LANGUAGE, there are no more keywords.



## [DAY-1] Dungeon Game

```
print("Welcome to the forest!")
print("This is a world of magic and wonders. You are on a cross road, you can go north east south or west.")
print("South leads to the swamps, where the aligators live")
print("West leads to the mountains, where the yeti lives")
print("North leads to the jungle, where the tigres live")
print("East leads to the desert, where the meerkats live")
print("")

what = input("what would you do next: ")

if what == "east":
  print("Welcome to the desert")
  print("It is very hot, and you need remember to put sun screen.")
  print("Oh, you remember to put your hat as well.")
  print("In the distance you see a meerkat approaching.")
  print("What would you do? Run or Fight the meerkat?")
  print("")

  what = input("what would you do next: ")
  if what == "run":
    print("You start running, and the meerkat is super fast, it catches you in no time.")
  elif what == "fight":
    print("You try to fight it, but turns out it was friendly and wants to become your friend.")
    print("What would you do?")
    print("")
    what = input("Do you want to be its friend: ")

    if what == "yes":
      print("Great! Now the meerkat wants to introduce you to his family.")
    elif what == "no":
      print("The meerkat starts crying!")

  else:
    print("I dont understand: " + what)
```

That is a lot of typing.

In python there are few very important things. First even though it doesn't look like it, it is actually a tree, like HTML tree. The parent of `print("The meerkat starts crying!")` is `elif what == "no":`

```
                    |
                    |
              if what == "east"
                   |
                 / |  \
                /  |   \
               /   |    \
              /    |     \
             /     |      \
          if      else    elif
    what == "run"  |     what == "fight
          |        |        |
        print   print      / \
                          /   \
                         /     \
                        /       \
                      if        elif
                what == "yes" what == "no"
                     |            |
                  [ ... ]      [ ... ]
```

Lets discuss another example:

```
a = "he"
b = "ll"
c = "o"
if a == "he":
  if b == "ll":
    if c == "o":
      print("hello")
```

Can you tell who is the parent of who?

BTW, you can also use `and`, `or` and `not` when you want to see if something is `True`

```
a = "he"
b = "ll"
c = "o"
if a == "he" and b == "ll" and c == "o":
  print("hello")
```

## [DAY-2] Dungeon Game

Our game is quite limited, and a quick step to improve it is to make you ask where you want to go until you pick one of the options.

```

def ask(possible_answers):
  answer = ''
  print("---") # print empty line
  while True:
    answer = input("> What would you do next: ")
    if answer not in possible_answers:
      print("> try again, it must be one of:", possible_answers)
    else:
      return answer

print("Welcome to the forest!")
#...

what = ask(["east","west","north","south"])

if what == "east":
  print("Welcome to the desert")
  #...

  what = ask(["run","fight"])
  if what == "run":
    print("You start running, and the meerkat is super fast, it catches you in no time.")
  elif what == "fight":
    print("You try to fight it, but turns out it was friendly and wants to become your friend.")
    # ...
    what = ask(["yes","no"])
    if what == "yes":
      print("Great! Now the meerkat wants to introduce you to his family.")
    elif what == "no":
      print("The meerkat starts crying!")
elif what == "north":
  print("Welcome to the north pole, it is super cold here.")

```

`ask` is a function, just like `print` or `input`, it will keep asking you `> What would you do next: ` until the answer you type is in the possible_answers list, and if it is it will return it to wherever it is called from. So when we have `zzz = ask(["yes","no"]` the value of `zzz` will be whatever is returned from `ask`. Same as `name = input("what is your name)` will put in `name` whatever is returned from `input` which is whatever you typed on your keyboard.

To make a function in python you need to use the `def` keyword.

```
def sum(a,b):
  return a + b

r = sum(1737,1231231)
print(r)

```

Whatever is between `def` and `(` is the name of the function, in the above example its `sum`. Between `()` you put in the name of the variables you expect to use when someone calls your function. I want to sum two numbers, I dont know what the numbers are, so I just make two variables `a, b` and expect whoever calls my function to give me the numbers, like `r = sum(1737,1231231)`
