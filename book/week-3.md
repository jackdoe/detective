## [DAY-0] View Source

Browsers on laptops or pcs will allow you to rightclick on any page and then click on `View page source`, this will show you the HTML of the page your are looking at.

Open https://archive.org then right click on the pager and then click on `View page source`.

We will spend the rest of the day looking at some page sources

* https://archive.org
* https://www.spacejam.com
* https://www.asciiart.eu/
* https://www.wikipedia.org
* https://www.gutenberg.org/
* https://digitalcomicmuseum.com/
* https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/
* https://www.goodreads.com/

## [DAY-1] Inspect


Make new html file and write the following example:

```
Right click on this page, click Inspect and then go to Console.
<script>
    console.log('🐺🐺🐺🐺 You can see that in the console. 🐺🐺🐺🐺')
    console.log('🐺🐺🐺🐺 type 12312*18237978123 in the console and see what happens. 🐺🐺🐺🐺')
</script>
```

Open the file and then click F12, or right click on the page and click Inspect. You will see the logs.

This will open the developer tools of your browser, you will be able to see the console, where you can run small programs or see the errors and the logs of the current page. Try writing `12312*18237978123` in the console and see the result.

In the inspector you can also modify the HTML that you see. This wont modify the actual page on the server you are downloading from, but you can try things to see how they would look. There are actually many scammers that use this method to lie to people as if they are giving them money, or they say 'I will teach you how to add 10000 robux to your account if you pay me 5$' and they just show you how to inspect and edit the html you see. This does not actually give you robux of course, it just modifies your local version of the html to show different value and after you reload the page you will see the old value.

Lets try it. Make a new file with this content:

```
<html>
  <body>
    Your Robux Balance is: <b>0$</b>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open the file and then right click on `0$` and click inspect. Then you will see `<b>0$</b>` if you double click on it, you will be able to change it, and you will see the new version. Now reload the page, and you will see the old value is back.


## [DAY-2] HTML Images

To show an image you need the `img` tag, and give it `src` attribute with the address of the image, for example if I want to display https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300 I have to do type it like this:

```
<html>
  <body>
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/40/200/300">
  </body>
</html>
```

Lets put the images in a table:

```
<html>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300">
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/40/200/300">
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now of course we can have `img` in `a`, try this:

```
<html>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <a href="https://wikipedia.com">
            <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300">
          </a>
        </td>
        <td>
          <a href="https://gutenberg.org">
            <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/40/200/300">
          </a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now you can click on the dog or the nose and it will lead you to the pages you link to.

Is it possible to have `img` and text in `a`? Well I am glad you asked!

```
<html>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <a href="https://wikipedia.com">
            <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300">
            <br>
            This dog leads to wikipedia
          </a>
        </td>
        <td>
          <a href="https://gutenberg.org">
            <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/40/200/300">
            <br>
            This cat (I think) leads to guttenberg.org
          </a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

I even have `<br>` in the `a`, now you can click either on the image or on the text.

There is one more very important attribute of the `img` tag, and this is the `alt` attribute, it is used by people who are blind or visually impaired to know what kind of picture is on the page. In our example we can put `alt="puppy"` on the puppy picture.

```
<p>
  Hello, and welcome to my page.
  I hope you will like this image.
</p>
<img src="https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300" alt="puppy">
```

If a blind person visits this page, they use a screen reader that reads most of the text on the page, and if we have `alt` attribute on images it will say `Image ...` and whatever the value of `alt` is, in our case "puppy". So the reader will say:

```
Hello, and welcome to my page. I hope you will like this image. 

Image puppy.
```

If you have an image that has no information, like it is just there to make the site pretty, use `alt=""` then the reader will skip it.
