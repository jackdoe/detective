## [DAY-0] View Source

Browsers on laptops or pcs will allow you to rightclick on any page and then click on `View page source`, this will show you the HTML of the page your are looking at.

Open https://archive.org then right click on the pager and then click on `View page source`.

We will spend the rest of the day looking at some page sources

* https://archive.org
* https://www.spacejam.com
* https://www.asciiart.eu/
* https://www.wikipedia.org
* https://www.gutenberg.org/
* https://digitalcomicmuseum.com/

## [DAY-1] Inspect


Make new html file and write the following example:

```
Right click on this page, click Inspect and then go to Console.
<script>
    console.log('🐺🐺🐺🐺 You can see that in the console. 🐺🐺🐺🐺')
    console.log('🐺🐺🐺🐺 type 12312*18237978123 in the console and see what happens. 🐺🐺🐺🐺')
</script>
```

Open the file and then click F12, or right click on the page and click Inspect. You will see the logs.

This will open the developer tools of your browser, you will be able to see the console, where you can run small programs or see the errors and the logs of the current page. Try writing `12312*18237978123` in the console and see the result.

In the inspector you can also modify the HTML that you see. This wont modify the actual page on the server you are downloading from, but you can try things to see how they would look. There are actually many scammers that use this method to lie to people as if they are giving them money, or they say 'I will teach you how to add 10000 robux to your account if you pay me 5$' and they just show you how to inspect and edit the html you see. This does not actually give you robux of course, it just modifies your local version of the html to show different value and after you reload the page you will see the old value.

Lets try it. Make a new file with this content:

```
<html>
  <body>
    Your Robux Balance is: <b>0$</b>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open the file and then right click on `0$` and click inspect. Then you will see `<b>0$</b>` if you double click on it, you will be able to change it, and you will see the new version. Now reload the page, and you will see the old value is back.
