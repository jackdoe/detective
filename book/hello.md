# Hello World

::: warning
This chapter is for parents, kids skip to the next one.
:::

This book is for parents who know how to code and for kids who don't, but especially for parents and kids who can spend 30 minutes per day, _every day_. I am writing this book as I am teaching my daughter (10), and you know how in some cooking shows, they skip the part where the food is cooking? I wont do that. The book will be longer than it should.

What you need:

* Computer
* Patience
* Internet
* Patience

If you don't have a you can buy raspberry pi 400 for 70$ or so, or something similar that you attach to your TV. If you don't have patience, buy some chamomile tea. You don't need internet subscription, but you would need a bit of internet to download python and do few google searches.

The schedule is roughly as follows:

* Week 0

In most of the weeks you also go back, waaay back, every day you re-iterate variables and for loops, print the numbers from one to 10 forever, ask how many times to be printed, etc.

The reason for so much emphasis on HTML is because it helps with understanding hierarchy, `tr` is child of `table`, `table` is child of `body` body is child of `html`, `td` is a sister to `td` and both are children of `tr` etc, it helped a lot with my daughter understanding how the `else` is sibling to the `if` and how both are children to `while`.

Also it is very easy to debug, and inspect, and get immediate feedback.
