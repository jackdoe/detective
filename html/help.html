        <p>If you want to write secret things its wise to use code, simply
        reversing the text already makes it difficult to read. For example:
        <i>?rof elgoog ot tahW</i> see? But it can get quite complicated in
        order to make it harder to read, so search for 'morse code', 'rot13',
        'pigpen'. Also ask your mom and dad for help, they must have used some

        <p>Computers do not understand text, so when you see text it is usually

        B, and so on.<br>About 60 years ago some people agreed on a common way
        to map number to character, called THE ASCII STANDARD, super fancy name,
        for such a simple thing.<br>I bet you came up with all kinds of number
        to letter code on your own! We would love to hear about it, so you can

        <p>The simplest thing you can do is make A to be B, B to be C and so on

        <p>All those are substitution ciphers, there is some sort of a map, or
        series of steps you take to transform the words into encrypted code, and
        then the inverse operation to go back from code into words.</p>
    </li>
    <li id="favorite_book"><topic>Favorite book.</topic>
        <p>let's say you and your friend have a favorite book, Alice in Wonderland<br>
        <img width="100%" style="max-width: 400px" src="/static/Lewis_Carroll_-_Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland.djvu.jpg"><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        So we can agree on code page number, row number, word number. For
        example: <code>3 1 3 3 14 8</code> is 'curiosity time' (page 3, row 1,
        word 3, page 3, row 14, word 8). Both you and your friend have to know
        the book you are going to use in advance. You can see this is quite more
        powerful than the previous substitution methods. Because now there is a
        piece of information that only you two know, and even if someone gets
        the code, there is little he can do to decrypt it. There are grownup
        methods to decipher this kind of code, but for kids it is quite
        difficult even if they get the code in plain sight.</p>
    </li>
    <li id="html"><topic>HTML</topic>
        <p>The app you are using right now to see this website is called a web
        browser, I don't know if kids still call it like that, but adults do. It
        works in a very similar way to the ASCII code and the other substitution
        ciphers.</p>
        <p>For example, try this on your page:
        <pre>
&lt;b>this is bold&lt;/b>
        </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            it will show:
            <div class='example'>
                <b>this is bold</b>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
        First the browser app downloads the web page, which is just a normal
        text file (it is what you see when you click on View Source), then it
        has to process it, in the same way you read pigpen code or ascii code,
        you look symbol by symbol and try to make sense out of it by making it
        into letters you understand.</p>

        <p>It looks for special characters '&lt;' and then '&gt;', like with the
        favorite book code, when you agree with your friend that the first digit
        will be the page, when it sees '&lt;' it knows what ever is between
        '&lt;' and '&gt;' is important word. Then it has kind of a table so it
        know what to do with different words, when it sees 'b' it knows that
        whatever is inside is gonna get <b>bold</b>.
        There are many words like that you should try for yourself 'b' 'i' 'u'
        'h1', and many more.</p>

        </p>let try some more things:<br>
        <pre>&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
      first &lt;b>item&lt;/b>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
      second &lt;i>item&lt;/i>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>&lt;h2>third&lt;/h2>
  &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></pre>
</p>
        <p>
        It will look like:<br>
        <div class='example'>
        <ul style="list-style: outside;">
            <li style="padding: 0px;border-bottom: 0px;">first <b>item</b></li>
            <li style="padding: 0px;border-bottom: 0px;">second <i>item</i></li>
            <li style="padding: 0px;border-bottom: 0px;"><h2>third</h2></li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>'ul' (which means unordered list) and 'li' means 'list item', so it
        makes it look like a list. 'h2' is to to make it big and on its own
        line, like the title of a book chapter.</p>

        Making lines:<br>
<pre>
first
line&lt;br>
second line&lt;br>
&lt;hr>
third line&lt;br>
</pre>

    <div class='example'>
        first
        line<br>
        second line<br>
        <hr>
        third line<br>
    </div><br>
        <p>'br' means line break, when the browser sees it know it has to show
        whatever comes next on another line, 'hr' means horizontal rule,just
        like when you take your ruler and draw a line from left to right in the
        text book. You see, even though you write things in separate lines (like
        the word first and line are clearly on separate lines), the browser will
        not know what to do until you tell it to 'br'. Maybe in school you had a
        project you have to use PowerPoint to make a presentation? With the
        special words ul, li, br, hr, h2 and b you can make your own
        presentation in HTML!</p>

        <p>'What I can not create, I do not understand' the poet said, so let's make
        our own language that we can use to combine LEGO bricks. How many brick
        kinds you know? Most common ones are small(2 bumps) square(4 bumps) and
        rectangle(8 bumps), they can be thick or thin, and there are also the
        weird ones with 6 bumps. And of course the one with only 1 bump and
        actually.. long ones with 1 line of 6 bumps or 8 or 12 bumps.</p>
        
        <p>We can just give them funny names, the 2x2 square will be 'gobby',
        2x6 will be 'moby'... let's just make a table</p>

        <p>.. this list is quite long and we are not even done yet, I will let

        we need to define how to join pieces together, for that we need a way to

        from left to right, so you take first piece, and then attach what
        follows to the specific stud, so stud 3,1 on mega-worm is on top of stud
        4,1 on pancake.</p>
        <p>And we have our plane! (well it requires a bit of imagination to call
        this a plane, but I am sure you can handle that part)</p>
        <img src="/static/plane.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 300px"><br><br>

        <p>So this is our language, we have a piece name, then describe which
        stud goes on below which stud, and that's it! we can build everything.
        Oh, but we don't have a name yet, let's call it... MEGALEGOLANG :D</p>
        
        <p>I will leave it up to you to write down the steps to build this:</p>
        <img src="/static/lego-2.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 300px"><br>
        <p>Haha no, I am joking! The instructions for this set described by
        using MEGALEGOLANG will be longer than the tallest building in the
        world! This language is quite limited, and actually quite inefficient,
        but the point I am trying to make is that, the words we made up have
        some meaning that we give to them, like 65 is 'A' in ASCII, but only
        because we know we are reading ASCII we can translate it. When you 'View
        Source' on any page, you will see <b>a lot</b> of words, some of which
        you will see for the first time, but try to remember, almost none of
        them do complicated things, you just have to know where to find
        information about them, usually searching in google for 'HTML
        word_you_are_looking_for' will give you what you need, try <a
        href="https://google.com/search?q=HTML+h2">HTML h2</a>, you will see
        lots of results, usually the results on developer.mozilla.org are
        great.</p>
    </li>

    <li id="supermegalegolang"><topic>SUPERMEGALEGOLANG</topic>
        <p>Ok, its obvious that using MEGALEGOLANG for serious projects will be
        a daunting task, I think it's time to make a better version that is
        easier to describe things in, MEGALEGOLANG makes it very difficult
        to describe the most important property of lego parts, connecting
        them together, because we have to describe each point, what if we are
        connecting tiles 12x12? we have to write a whole page of instructions
        just to connect two pieces.
        </p>

        <p>What is the minimum amount of information we need in order to connect
        two things?</p>
        <p>First we need to know the kind of pieces we are connecting.
        We can stick to our current method of using a table that uniquely
        identifies each piece, which is not ideal, but will do the job for now.
        </p>

        <p>Second, we need to know at least one bump and then their orientation.
        That means we have to know where is it pointing at, so to do that we
        will draw 2 lines that have a right angle between them, if you don't
        know what a right angle is, or what an angle do not worry. It is just a
        part of a circle. I will give names to the lines so it is easier to talk
        about them, the line going up we will call Y, and line going right we
        will call X, as I said previously, don't be scared of names of
        things.</p>
        <img src="/static/circle.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 300px"><br>
        <p>
            See the amount of circle between the X line and the lego piece
            is ZERO! it is right on the line, so we call this orientation 0<br>
            <img src="/static/angle-0.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 300px">
        </p>
        <p>
            This one is exactly 1/4th of the circle, and we have decided to have 360 pieces in a circle, since ancient times, 360/4 is 90, so this is orientation is 90<br>
            <img src="/static/angle-90.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 300px">
        </p>
        <p>this one is half of 90, so 45<br>
            <img src="/static/angle-45.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 300px">
        </p>
        <p>
            We should keep the orientation and the stud numbering separate, so
            2,2 or 1,8 will always assume the piece is oriented in position
            orientation 0. Now if we say bump 3,2 orientated 0 on mega-worm
            connects to 1,1 on pika oriented 90, it will look like this:<br>
            <img src="/static/connect.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 300px">

        </p>
        <p>
            Now, it is time to improve our language,let's try:
            <pre><i>piece name(orientation,x,y)</i>

our plane looks like this:
pancake(0,1,4)->mega-worm(90,1,3)
dodo(0,1,2)->mega-worm(90,8,1)</pre>

        </p>
        <p>Wow! so much simpler! .. Well we had to introduce orientation and
            angles and stuff, but we have to write way less, in the same time,
            maybe the previous language is actually simpler, because we only
            have to know about bumps and that's it.</p>
    
        <p>
            You are learning to do computer stuff when everything is 'simple',
            and yet it is not really, it just has a lot of meaning hidden inside
            few words, so just keep digging, whenever you stumble on something
            that doesn't make sense, first view source, then google, then try to
            use it, and then try to make it yourself, because when you can make
            something yourself, that is when you truly understand it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes we want to connect complicated pieces together, so for example, we have our plane, and we want to connect it to another plane
            <pre>PLANE:
  pancake(0,1,4)->mega-worm(90,1,3)
  dodo(0,1,2)->mega-worm(90,8,1)

PLANE(0,1,1)->PLANE(0,2,2)
</pre>
PLANE() just like pancake() takes orientation, x, y, so after the plane is
built, and in your hand, you can connect it with the other PLANE() on the
specific bumps, you will also see that our language breaks down at this point,
because we would need another parameter, in order to uniquely identify a bump we
have how much on the left, top and how tall it is.
</p>
<p>
    In order to make it work we would need something like
    <code>PLANE(0,1,1,0)->PLANE(0,2,2,0)</code>, where the 4th element will say
    which piece from the bottom we are addressing. for this I think its easier
    to just count pieces, like 1,2,3 from the bottom.
</p>
<p>
    So our program be comes:
    <pre>PLANE:
  pancake(0,1,4)->mega-worm(90,1,3)
  dodo(0,1,2)->mega-worm(90,8,1)

PLANE(0,1,1,0)->PLANE(0,2,2,1)
      </pre>
      
    <p>
        I feel we can do better than this mega-worm, pancake business, because
        we can already define 1x5 or 2x2, 2x8 bricks, so maybe its better to
        just pass them as parameters? We will also introduce a new label START,
        so whatever is in it we do first.
<pre>
PLANE:
    CONNECT(
        1x8,  0, 1, 4,
        2x8, 90, 1, 3 
    )

    CONNECT(
        2x4,  0, 1, 2, 
        2x8, 90, 8, 1
    )

START:
    CONNECT(
        PLANE(), 0, 1, 1, 0,
        PLANE(), 0, 2, 2, 1
    )
</pre>
We can now connect whatever is the result of PLANE(), to something else.<br>
<pre>
PLANE:
    CONNECT(
        1x8,  0, 1, 4,
        2x8, 90, 1, 3 
    )

    CONNECT(
        2x4,  0, 1, 2,
        2x8, 90, 8, 1
    )
MEGAPLANE:
    CONNECT(
        PLANE(), 0, 1, 1, 0,
        PLANE(), 0, 2, 2, 1
    )

START:
    CONNECT(
        MEGAPLANE(), 0, 8, 1, 1,
        2x8,        90, 8, 1, 0
    )
    </pre><br>

    This is very powerful! you see we can keep combining those objects into
    making bigger and bigger things.
</p>

    </li>
    <li id="code"><topic>CODE</topic>
        <p>Its time to write some real code, try this on your page:</p>
        <pre>&lt;script>
    var password = prompt('what is the password?')
    if (password == 'everest') {
        alert('WELCOME!')
    } else {
        alert('GO AWAYY!')
    }
&lt;/script>
        </pre>
        <p>First try it and then continue to read.</p>
        .<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
        <p>Did you try it?</p>
        <p>Ok, lets go word by word. <b>&ltscript></b> is a special HTML word,
        like 'ul' or 'h2' that tells the browser that whatever is inside is
        code, its not supposed to show this text as text or as HTML, but run
        this little program, and let it do what it does. Kind of like our
        SUPERMEGALEGOLANG, its just a set of instructions</p>
        
        <p><b>prompt</b>, is like a mini program, will tell the browser to ask
        you a question, it will return whatever you wrote in it. Kind of like
        the instructions to make a PLANE in SUPERMEGALEGOLANG, with one
        difference that in SUPERMEGALEGOLANG you are holding the result in your
        hand, so its obvious where it is, in case of prompt() it will return the
        result to wherever it was called.</p>
        <p><b>var password</b> is a variable, its just a place we can put
        whatever value we want, we can say 'var password = 123', its the '='
        that puts whatever is on the right side of it, into whatever variable is
        on the left. so var password = prompt('what time is it'), puts the
        result of the prompt mini program into the variable password. 
        </p>

        <p>Next comes <b>'if(something) { do A } else { do B }'</b>
            the squiggly brackets just group a bunch of instructions together in
            a 'block' of code, so what this does is if something is true, then it 
            will 'do A', otherwise it will 'do B'
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>alert</b> will show a popup with whatever alert you give it. Wanna try something funny?
            <pre>&lt;script>
    alert(prompt('guess a number between 1 and 1 million and I will tell you what it is:'))
&lt;/script></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Quick note about the quotation marks <b>'</b>, the same way the
            browser reads &lt;&gt; to make sense, when it is reading a script,
            it actually does not know what is a special word, and what is some
            text you wrote. so if I say 'if (password == everest)' it will be
            confused, what is everest, it has never seen it in the program
            before, but if I say 'everest' it knows has to compare the value of
            variable password with the text 'everest'.
        </p>
